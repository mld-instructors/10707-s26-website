      <h2>Course Outline</h2>
      <p></p>
      <p>Building intelligent machines that are capable of extracting meaningful representations from high-dimensional
        data lies at the core of solving many AI related tasks. In the past few years, researchers across many different
        communities, from applied statistics to engineering, computer science and neuroscience, have developed deep
        (hierarchical) models -- models that are composed of several layers of nonlinear processing. An important
        property of these models is that they can learn useful representations by re-using and combining intermediate
        concepts, allowing these models to be successfully applied in a wide variety of domains, including visual object
        recognition, information retrieval, natural language processing, and speech perception. This is an advanced
        graduate course, designed for Masters and Ph.D. level students, and will assume a reasonable degree of
        mathematical maturity. The goal of this course is to introduce students to the recent and exciting developments
        of various deep learning methods.</p>

      <p>This course covers some of the theory and methodology of deep learning. The preliminary set of topics to be
        covered include:</p>

      <b>Homeworks:</b> Each student will have a total of <b>5 grace days</b> that a student may choose to apply to the
      homework assignments.
      No more than 3 grace days can be used on any single assignment.
      These grace days will be applied greedily and automatically; you do not have to email us to apply to use these.
      <b>NOTE: Homeworks submitted late when the student has no grace days remaining or 3 days past the deadline will be

      <dt id="extensions">Extensions</dt>
      <p>In general, we do not grant extensions on assignments. There are several exceptions:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Medical Emergencies:</strong> If you are sick and unable to complete an
          assignment or attend class, please go to University Health
          Services. For minor illnesses, we expect grace days or our late
          penalties to provide sufficient accommodation. For medical
          emergencies (e.g. prolonged hospitalization), students may request
          an extension afterwards and should include a note from University
          Health Services.</li>
        Certificate</b> or a <b>written</b> (not email) request submitted at least one week before the due date and
        approved by the instructor. Please plan ahead.
        <li><strong>Family/Personal Emergencies:</strong> If you have a family emergency
          (e.g. death in the family) or a personal emergency (e.g. mental
          health crisis), please contact your academic adviser or Counseling
          and Psychological Services (CaPS). In addition to offering support,
          your academic adviser may reach out to the instructors for all your courses on your
          behalf to request an extension. (Note that it should be the adviser and not
          CaPS who requests for an extension.)</li>
        <li><strong>University-Approved Absences:</strong> If you are attending an
          out-of-town university approved event (e.g. multi-day
          athletic/academic trip organized by the university), you may request
          an extension for the duration of the trip. You must provide
          confirmation of your attendance, usually from a faculty or staff
          organizer of the event.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>For any of the above situations, you may request an extension by emailing the Educational Associate Brynn
        Edmunds at bedmunds@andrew.cmu.edu
        – do not email the instructor or TAs. The email should be sent as soon as you are aware of the conflict and at
        least 5 days prior to the deadline.
        In the case of an emergency, no notice is needed.</p>

      <dt id="audit-policy">Audit Policy</dt>

      <p>Auditing of the course (i.e. taking the course for an “Audit”
        grade) is not permitted this semester.</p>

      <dt id="passfail-policy">Pass/Fail Policy</dt>

      <p>We allow you take the course as Pass/Fail. Instructor permission is
        not required. What grade is the cutoff for Pass will depend on your
        program. Be sure to check with your program / department as to whether
        you can count a Pass/Fail course towards your degree requirements.</p>

      <dt id="accommodations-for-students-with-disabilities">Accommodations for Students with Disabilities:</dt>

      <p>If you have a disability and have an accommodation letter from the Disability Resources office, I encourage
        you to discuss your accommodations and needs with Brynn Edmunds (bedmunds@andrew.cmu.edu) as early in the
        semester
        as possible. We will work with you to ensure that accommodations are provided as appropriate. If you suspect
        that
        you may have a disability and would benefit from accommodations but are not yet registered with the Office of
        Disability Resources, I encourage you to contact them at

      <ul>
        <li>The purpose of student collaboration is to facilitate learning, not to circumvent it. Studying the material
          in groups is strongly encouraged. It is also allowed to seek help from other students in understanding the
          material needed to solve a particular homework problem, provided no written notes (including code) are shared,
          or are taken at that time, and provided learning is facilitated, not circumvented. The actual solution must be
          done by each student alone.</li>
        <li>The presence or absence of any form of help or collaboration, whether given or received, must be explicitly
          stated and disclosed in full by all involved. Specifically, each assignment solution must include answering
          the following questions:
          <ol>

      <dt id="previously-used-assignments">Previously Used Assignments</dt>

      <p>Some of the homework assignments used in this class may have been used in prior versions of this class, or in
        classes at other institutions, or elsewhere. Solutions to them may be, or may have been, available online, or
        from other people or sources. It is explicitly forbidden to use any such sources, or to consult people who have
        solved these problems before. It is explicitly forbidden to search for these problems or their solutions on the
        internet. You must solve the homework assignments completely on your own. We will be actively monitoring your
        compliance. Collaboration with other students who are currently taking the class is allowed, but only under the
        conditions stated above.</p>

      <dt id="policy-regarding-found-code">Policy Regarding “Found Code”:</dt>

      <p>You are encouraged to read books and other instructional materials, both online and offline, to help you
        understand the concepts and algorithms taught in class. These materials may contain example code or pseudo code,
        which may help you better understand an algorithm or an implementation detail. However, when you implement your
        own solution to an assignment, you must put all materials aside, and write your code completely on your own,
        starting “from scratch”. Specifically, you may not use any code you found or came across. If you find or come
        across code that implements any part of your assignment, you must disclose this fact in your collaboration
        statement.</p>

      <dt id="duty-to-protect-ones-work">Duty to Protect One’s Work</dt>

      <p>Students are responsible for pro-actively protecting their work from copying and misuse by other students. If a
        student’s work is copied by another student, the original author is also considered to be at fault and in gross
        violation of the course policies. It does not matter whether the author allowed the work to be copied or was
        merely negligent in preventing it from being copied. When overlapping work is submitted by different students,
        both students will be punished.</p>

      <p>To protect future students, do not post your solutions publicly, neither during the course nor afterwards.</p>

      <dt id="penalties-for-violations-of-course-policies">Penalties for Violations of Course Policies</dt>

      <p>All violations (even first one) of course policies will always be
        reported to the university authorities (your Department Head,
        Associate Dean, Dean of Student Affairs, etc.) as an official Academic
        Integrity Violation and will carry severe penalties.</p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          The penalty for the first violation is a one-and-a-half letter
          grade reduction. For example, if your final letter grade for the
          course was to be an A-, it would become a C+.
        </li>
        <li>
          The penalty for the second violation is failure in the course, and
          can even lead to dismissal from the university.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h3 id="8-support">Support</h3>

      <p>Take care of yourself. Do your best to maintain a healthy lifestyle this semester by eating well, exercising,
        avoiding drugs and alcohol, getting enough sleep and taking some time to relax. This will help you achieve your
        goals and cope with stress.</p>

      <p>All of us benefit from support during times of struggle. You are not alone. There are many helpful resources
        available on campus and an important part of the college experience is learning how to ask for help. Asking for
        support sooner rather than later is often helpful.</p>

      <p>If you or anyone you know experiences any academic stress, difficult life events, or feelings like anxiety or
        depression, we strongly encourage you to seek support. Counseling and Psychological Services (CaPS) is here to
        help: call 412-268-2922 and visit their website at <a
          href="http://www.cmu.edu/counseling/">http://www.cmu.edu/counseling/</a>. Consider reaching out to a friend,
        faculty or family member you trust for help getting connected to the support that can help.</p>

      <p>If you or someone you know is feeling suicidal or in danger of self-harm, call someone immediately, day or
        night:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>CaPS: 412-268-2922</li>
        <li>Re:solve Crisis Network: 888-796-8226</li>
        <li>If the situation is life threatening, call the police:
          <ul>
            <li>On campus: CMU Police: 412-268-2323</li>
